Hinge loss is a loss function commonly used in Support Vector Machines. Its goal is to 
maximize the margin between classes by penalizing predictions that are on the opposite 
side of their true class. The hinge loss function is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    L(y) = \max(0, 1 - y \cdot f(x)) 
\end{equation}
where $y$ is the actual value and $f(x)$ is the predicted value.

It should be noted that even correct predictions are penalized if they are not confident 
enough.
