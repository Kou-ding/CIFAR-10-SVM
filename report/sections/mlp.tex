Another model with which we have worked on the first assignment is MLP also known as 
Multi-Layer Perceptron. One aspect in which we are going to divert from the first 
assignment's implementation, is the loss function. Here we will be using the Hinge loss 
function which is going to allow us to directly compare the MLP with the SVM.
