Support Vector Machines are supervised maximum margin models that are used for problems 
such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Classification
    \item Regression
    \item Distribution Estimation
\end{itemize}
They are considered supervised because they need a pre-labeled training set to develop 
the hyperplanes that separate the classes. The terminology maximum margin refers to the
fact that the SVM tries to solve a convex optimization problem which maximizes the 
distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. This 
distance is called "margin".
