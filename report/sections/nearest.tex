First nearest neighbor, third nearest neighbor and nearest centroid are three basic
classification algorithms we will be taking from the first assignment to compare our
SVM with. These as we have explained previously are algorithms that classify by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nearest Neighbor: Assigns to the test point the class of the nearest to it 
    centroid calculated from all the points in the training dataset. 
    \item 1 Nearest Centroid: Assigns to the test point the class of the closest to it 
    point from the training dataset.
    \item 3 Nearest Neighbor: Assigns to the test point the average class of the closest
    to it 3 points from the training dataset.
\end{itemize}
