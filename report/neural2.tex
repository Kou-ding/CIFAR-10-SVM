\begin{abstract}
This is the second Assignment of the course "Neural Networks-Deep Learning". It revolves around
creating a Support Vector Machine and and training it on the CIFAR-10 dataset to successfully 
classify the images into one of the 10 classes. The algorithm used is analyzed extensively and
results both in the testing and training phase are presented. SVM is challenged by other similar
algorithms that are also trained on the CiFAR-10 dataset and try to solve the same classification 
problem. These rival algorithms include 1 and 3 Nearest Neighbor, Nearest Centroid and MLP with
one hidden layer using Hinge loss.
